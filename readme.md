#  Think Tomorrow project skeleton


This project is the skeleton we use at Think Tomorrow when we start a new project.

To use this as the base for a project you can install this using the compose create-project cli tool.

```
composer create-project thinktomorrow/project-skeleton projectname --keep-vcs
```

Keep in mind that the --keep-vcs flag will keep the git files so you should remove the .git folder and initialize your own.
We run this with the flag to preserve our .gitignore files.
